By Queen website is an open door for business. Here web users contact me to discuss about graphic design, web develpment, photography portfolio, and visual projects.

The bar menu displays four buttons to navigate through the same homepage.

The hero is an attention graber. In appreciation of the interviewer's time I offer a black small coffe. 

The body of the website contains some block text with descriptions about me, work, and contact information of how the they can reach me out.

Finally, the footer just close the design of the homepage.
